| By Zhang Li, PhD Student, School of Science, Westlake University

This code, based on Matlab, is designed for Sum Frequency Generation Data Processing.

The primary program is named DataProcess.m. You can modify this code by specifying the path to your data file. When you run it, it will process the data by removing cosmic ray interference and background noise, then normalize it using your reference.

Additionally, there are other codes that consist of functions utilized in this data processing procedure.
